# Computing a better estimate how long a PR was been awaiting review.

This code is rather project-agnostic, *provided* the definitions in classify_pr_state.py
have been updated to match the current project. More precisely, the methods
|first_on_queue_inner| and |total_queue_time_inner| assume there is a variant PRStatus.AwaitingReview
(which is a rather mild assumption). If a project prefers naming this differently,
they should adjust the variant name.

**Problem.** We would like a way to track the progress of PRs, and especially learn which PRs
have been waiting long for review. Currently, we have no good way of obtaining this information:
we use the crude heuristic of
"this PR was last updated X ago, and is awaiting review now" as a metric for "waiting for time X".

That metric is imperfect because
- not everything "updating" a PR is meaningful for our purposes
If somebody edits the PR description to describe the change better
or tweaks the code to make it better understood --- without other activity
and not in response to feedback --- that is a good thing,
but does not change the PR's review status.
- a PR's time on the review queue is often interrupted by having merge conflicts.
This is usually only a temporary state, but means long streaks of no changes are much more rare.
In particular, this disadvantages conflict-prone PRs.

**A better metric** would be to track the PRs state over time, and compute
e.g. the total amount of time this PR was awaiting review.
This is what we attempt to do.

## Input data
This algorithm process a sequence of events "on X, this PR changed in this and that way"
and returns a list of all times when the PRs state changed:
for the purposes of our analysis, this could be "a PR became blocked on another PR",
"a PR became unblocked", "a PR was marked as waiting on author", "a PR incurred a merge conflict".

From this information, we can compute the total time a PR was waiting for review, for instance.

## Implementation notes

This file contains the *analysis* of the given input data; the input data parsing
is done elsewhere.
